# Molang animations

PulseLib evaluates Molang expressions in Gecko animation vectors. A numeric vector component may therefore be written either as a JSON number or as a Molang string:

```json
{
  "bones": {
    "head": {
      "rotation": ["math.sin(query.anim_time * 180) * 15", 0, 0],
      "position": [0, "query.vertical_offset", 0]
    }
  }
}
```

The Gecko parser compiles each string into a `MolangParser.Expression` while the model is loaded. It does not parse the source again every tick or for every bone. The compiled expression is evaluated when the current animation pose is mixed.

## Context and evaluation

Each built-in renderer prepares one frame context per animation controller and render pass. The controller copies its frame-specific query and context values into its own persistent `MolangParser.Context` before it mixes the pose. This applies to entity, block entity, item, and item GUI rendering, including recursive GUI drawing.

The renderer supplies these values by default:

* `query.anim_time` (also available as `q.anim_time`) is the controller's interpolated animation time in seconds.
* `this` is supplied by the animation mixer from the accumulated value of the vector component currently being evaluated.
* `math.random`, `math.random_integer`, `math.die_roll`, and `math.die_roll_integer` use the controller's persistent random state. If deterministic results are required for custom code, seed it through `controller.persistentMolangContext().randomSeed(...)`.

This split keeps render-specific queries fresh without sharing Molang variables or random sequences between different controllers.

## Providing custom queries

Override `populateMolangContext` in the renderer for the animatable type. The hook exists in `PEntityRenderer`, `PBlockRenderer`, and `PItemRenderer`.

```java
@Override
protected void populateMolangContext(RobotEntity robot,
                                     PAnimationController<RobotEntity> controller,
                                     MolangParser.Context context,
                                     float partialTick) {
    context.query("ground_speed", (float) robot.getDeltaMovement().horizontalDistance());
    context.query("is_active", robot.isActive() ? 1f : 0f);
}
```

The model can then use `q.ground_speed` and `query.is_active`. Query names are not globally predefined by PulseLib: a renderer exposes only the values appropriate for its animatable.

`MolangParser.Context` also exposes `query(...)`, `variable(...)`, `context(...)`, `thisValue(...)`, and `queryResolver(...)` for custom rendering paths that construct their own context.

## Language surface

The parser supports numeric literals, arithmetic, comparisons, logical operators, ternary expressions, statements, assignments to `temp.*` and `variable.*`, `return`, `loop`, and `break`. It resolves the `query.*`, `variable.*`, `temp.*`, and `context.*` namespaces and their usual short aliases (`q`, `v`, `t`, and `c`).

Supported math functions include trigonometry, interpolation, clamping, rounding, powers, min/max, random and die-roll functions, plus the implemented `math.ease_*` variants. An unsupported function is reported as an error instead of silently evaluating to an arbitrary value.

## `variable.*` lifetime

`variable.*` assignments persist for the lifetime of a `PAnimationController`, including across render frames. They are private to that controller, so two controllers do not overwrite each other's variables. `temp.*` remains local to one expression evaluation.
