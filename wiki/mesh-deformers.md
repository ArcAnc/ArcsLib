# Mesh deformers

Mesh deformers modify vertices after a mesh has been baked. A stack may contain several ordered operations, such as bend followed by twist. PulseLib derives transformed normals from the deformation Jacobian, so lighting follows the deformed surface.

The built-in stacks are evaluated by the GPU in both the queued renderer and the immediate (`instant`) renderer, including GUI item rendering. PulseLib uploads operation definitions and per-instance channel values to shared `RGBA32_FLOAT` texel buffers; the vertex shader applies the deformation to both position and normal. A stack with at most eight directly compiled built-in operations uses this path. Unsupported or custom stacks automatically fall back to a CPU-deformed vertex buffer, so they remain functional but do not receive the GPU batching benefit.

Built-in operations are registered as `pulselib:bend`, `pulselib:hinge`, `pulselib:twist`, `pulselib:stretch`, `pulselib:squash`, `pulselib:taper`, and `pulselib:wave`.

## Build a stack

Definitions use local mesh coordinates. Axes are normalized during preparation; `positiveExtent` and `negativeExtent` define the interval along a length axis, measured from `origin`. Angles are radians.

```java
private static final PChannelReference<Float> KNEE_ANGLE =
        new PChannelReference<>("knee_angle", 0.0f);

private static final PDeformerStack KNEE_BEND = PDeformerStack.compile(List.of(
        new PDeformerInstance<>(PBendDeformer.INSTANCE, new PBendDefinition(
                new Vector3f(0.0f, 6.0f, 0.0f), // origin
                new Vector3f(0.0f, 1.0f, 0.0f), // length axis
                new Vector3f(1.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f), // bend axis
                6.0f, 0.0f,                    // positive and negative extents
                KNEE_ANGLE))));
```

`PChannelReference` names a runtime float input and supplies its neutral fallback. Use `PChannelReference.constant(value)` for a fixed value. Stacks are immutable after `compile(...)`; use `PDeformerStack.compose(first, second)` to make a longer stack.

## Built-in operations

| Id | Definition | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `pulselib:bend` | `PBendDefinition` | Bends an interval around an arbitrary perpendicular axis. `angle` is the total bend angle. |
| `pulselib:hinge` | `PHingeDefinition` | Rotates the positive side of a plane around `hingeAxis`. |
| `pulselib:twist` | `PTwistDefinition` | Rotates vertices progressively around `lengthAxis`; `angle` is the total twist. |
| `pulselib:stretch` | `PStretchDefinition` | Scales displacement along `axis`; `scale = 1` is neutral. |
| `pulselib:squash` | `PSquashDefinition` | Scales along `axis` and compensates perpendicular axes to preserve local volume. `scale = 1` is neutral. |
| `pulselib:taper` | `PTaperDefinition` | Scales the radial component from `1` at the negative end to `tipScale` at the positive end. |
| `pulselib:wave` | `PWaveDefinition` | Applies a sine displacement inside the interval. It uses `amplitude`, `phase`, and a positive `wavelength`. |

For bend and wave, the secondary axis must not be parallel to `lengthAxis`. All interval deformers reject an empty interval; stretch, squash, and taper clamp a non-positive scale to a small positive value.

## Custom model meshes

Use `PMeshDeformation` with a `PMeshRenderContext` to deform a baked triangle mesh. The `cacheKey` must be a stable non-null object for one independently rendered deformation. It identifies the cached CPU vertex buffer only when PulseLib must use its fallback; GPU-supported stacks keep the base vertex buffer and send their values as instance data instead.

```java
private final Object bendBufferKey = new Object();

PMeshDeformation deformation = new PMeshDeformation(
        KNEE_BEND,
        reference -> reference.name().equals(KNEE_ANGLE.name())
                ? currentAngleRadians()
                : reference.defaultValue(),
        bendBufferKey,
        2);

return baseMeshRenderContext().withDeformation(deformation);
```

`PMeshDeformation` subdivides the source triangle mesh only when necessary. Level `0` uses the original mesh; the default is `2`; valid levels are `0` through `4`. Higher levels make curved bends smoother but increase vertex count exponentially per source triangle. The subdivided source is cached per baked mesh and level, then used by either the GPU or CPU fallback.

`PDeformerStack.compose(...)` and custom `PMeshDeformer` implementations are valid APIs, but they currently use the CPU fallback because they do not carry a directly translatable built-in definition list. Prefer one directly compiled stack of built-in definitions when deformation performance matters.

## Player animations

Attach a stack directly to a player animation definition. It is active only while that definition contributes, samples controller time with `partialTick`, and fades every channel back to its default during an activation crossfade.

```java
PPlayerAnimationDefinition.builder(model)
        .bind(PPlayerPart.RIGHT_LEG, "right_leg")
        .deform(PPlayerPart.RIGHT_LEG, KNEE_BEND, (context, reference) -> {
            if (!reference.name().equals(KNEE_ANGLE.name()))
                return reference.defaultValue();
            return kneeCurve(context.controllerSeconds("acrobatics"));
        })
        .build();
```

`PPlayerAnimationDeformerContext` exposes `player()`, `definition()`, `partialTick()`, `weight()`, `isPlaying(controller)`, `controllerTicks(controller)`, and `controllerSeconds(controller)`. `weight()` already includes definition, activation-fade, and part weights. Several `.deform(...)` calls may target one part and run in declaration order. Player deformations apply to outer skin layers and compatible armor model parts.

`PPlayerMeshDeformers.register(id, part, predicate, stack, values)` remains available for a deformation that is independent of an animation definition. Use `frameAt(...)` to obtain a deformed attachment position and an orthonormal `right`/`up`/`forward` frame; its overload with `partialTick` matches interpolated player animation renders.

## Custom deformer types

Implement `PMeshDeformer<D>` for a new operation. `codec()` describes a serializable definition and `prepare(...)` creates one or more efficient `PPreparedDeformer` operations. Register the type through `PulseLibEvents.TypeRegistrationEvent` on the client mod event bus; PulseLib owns the internal registry.

```java
public final class MyDeformer implements PMeshDeformer<MyDefinition> {
    @Override public Identifier id() { return MY_ID; }
    @Override public MapCodec<MyDefinition> codec() { return MyDefinition.CODEC; }

    @Override
    public void prepare(PDeformerPrepareContext context, MyDefinition definition) {
        context.add((position, values) -> {
            // Modify position in place.
        });
    }
}
```

```java
@Mod.EventBusSubscriber(modid = ExampleMod.MOD_ID,
        bus = Mod.EventBusSubscriber.Bus.MOD,
        value = Dist.CLIENT)
public final class ExampleClientEvents {
    @SubscribeEvent
    public static void registerTypes(PulseLibEvents.TypeRegistrationEvent event) {
        event.registerMeshDeformer(MyDeformers.INSTANCE);
    }
}
```

Use the same event's `registerAnimationChannel(...)` and `registerAnimationEvent(...)` methods for custom animation channel and event types. Registration rejects duplicate identifiers.

Do not retain mutable render state inside a prepared operation. Read changing values through `PDeformerValueSource` instead.
